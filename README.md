## Compression_2d

Compression_2D is a 2D simple longitudinal tracking code for tracking changes to the longitudinal phase space (LPS). This has been developed for modelling of the UK-XFEL. 
Compression_2D includes acceleration and compression elements which can be used to represent FEL beamlines.
A series of optimisation and plotting functions have been developed to plot and optimise the LPS throughout the machine.

This code is based upon Zagorodnov & Dohlus, Semianalytical modelling of multistage bunch compression with collective effects, PRAB 14, 014403 (2011).
